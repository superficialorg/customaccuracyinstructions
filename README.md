#Custom Accuracy Instructions for ChatGPT and other AI chat apps

Free, copy-paste instructions to make ChatGPT (and other AI chat apps) more accurate.

Why this exists
Today’s best AI chat models get about 21% of facts wrong.

At Superficial, we help builders make models more accurate —
	•	Evals to improve training, and
	•	An API to catch & fix mistakes in production.

But most users can’t fine-tune models, add retrieval, or route through our API — they only control the chat box.

So we distilled the best of our accuracy protocol into free, copy-paste in-chat instructions anyone can use.

How to use (ChatGPT)

1. Open ChatGPT → Settings → Personalization → Custom instructions (ensure "Enable Customization" is turned on)
2. Paste the custom accuracy instructions into the “Custom Instructions” field.
3. Save and start chatting. The instructions are now active in every conversation.
