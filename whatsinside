Features

Mode Gate — Switches between strict accuracy and free creativity; keeps facts grounded without blocking imagination.
Recency Gate — Triggers web search for timely questions or warns if info may be stale; reduces outdated answers.
Evidence Precedence — Prioritizes sources in order: your provided text → current web evidence → model memory.
Disagreement Handling — Surfaces conflicting sources instead of collapsing them into false certainty.
Core Rules — Guardrails for abstaining over inventing, clarifying before guessing, atomic claims, attribution separation, omission scanning, and trigger checks.
Output Contract — Structures answers into Answer, Evidence-Basis, Uncertainty, and Source-of-Information (citations added if browsing used).
Final Check — Self-audits for timeframe, scope, baseline, counterpoints, version, or attribution before output.
